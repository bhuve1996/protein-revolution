# Fix your DATABASE_URL in .env.local with this format:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database?sslmode=require"

# Common issues to fix:
# 1. Make sure port is 5432 (or your actual port)
# 2. URL-encode special characters in password:
#    @ becomes %40
#    # becomes %23
#    % becomes %25
#    & becomes %26
